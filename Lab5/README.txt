CMPE 012 Fall 2018

-------------------------

What was your design approach?
allowing the user to input a string
and compare the input to the word set
checking every char
ingore the punctuations except space
if the user is in time and correct 
move on to the next word set

What did you learn in this lab?
I learned how to use subprogram in mips
how to return value from the subprogram back.
I also learned how the timer works,
getting current time in $a0, $a1.


Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
I had trouble on doing the extra credit part
ignoring the punctuations makes the length of str unstable
so I just ignore the punctuations while counting the length
Doing the timer part is really enjoyable.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
Maybe there can be a time alert when user is out of time

----------------------------
The text of your prompt (“Please input a positive integer: ”) 
and output strings (“Flux” and “Bunny”) are stored in the 
processor’s memory. After assembling your program, what is the 
range of addresses in which these strings are stored?
0x10010000 to 0x10010040 

What were the learning objectives of this lab?
Register, Address, MIPS, Loop, If-statement

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
I didn't know how to get the mod because you can't get it directly.
And the method of using mfhi is really helpful and fun to learn.
It is a greate experience to learn how loop and if statement work.


How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
Let students learn about the differences of the registers: $zero, $v0, $a0, $t0, $s0
Using double for loop or while loop instead of just using one for loop

-------------------------

What did you learn in this lab?
I learned how to use D Flip Flop.
I learned how to write adder in binary with logic circuit.
I learned how to display negative numbers.

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
The comparator worked well.
I had some problems with my displayer.
It failed to show correct negative number when it changed from 0 to -1.
But I figured it out that my SOP method was wrong.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I think there needs to be more parts involving number transition.
Using different ways of displaying negative numbers.

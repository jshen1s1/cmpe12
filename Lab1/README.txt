LAB 1: Intro to Logic Simulation
CMPE 012 Fall 2018

What did you learn in this lab?
I learned how to convert different gates into NAND and NOR gates. 
And the meaning of each input of the seven segment.
This leb helps me review the SOP and POS methods.

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
Implement the Truth table by SOP or POS is easy for me. 
Because it is covered in CE16.
I did some research on how to convert gates.
Also, I didn't know what seven segment is before this lab.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I would ask them to simplify and find out the minimal form of the logic equation.
So that the circuit would be much easier to read.

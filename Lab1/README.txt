-------------------------

What did you learn in this lab?
I learned how to convert different gates to NAND and NOR gates.

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
I did some research on how to convert gates.
Also, I didn't know what is seven segment works before this lab.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I would ask them to simplify, find out the minimal form of the logic equation.
